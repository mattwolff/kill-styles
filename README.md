# Kill Styles

A simple tool to quickly show what any website(read as: most sites...) would look like with no CSS running. Drag this little bookmarklet up into your bookmarks bar.

Online at: [kill-styles.matt-wolff.com](https://kill-styles.matt-wolff.com)

Won't have any affect on styles generated by JS after the initial press. Could add an interval function to continue killing styles forever... Later, maybe.

Other problems? ...Open an issue.

- Simplified and updated to Vanilla JS. Helps avoid any jQuery CORS issues.
